## Ludo-Game
Ludo is a board game for two to four players, in which the players race their four tokens from start to finish according to dice rolls

## Game Rules
On each throw, the player decides which piece to move. A piece simply moves in a clockwise direction around the track given by the number thrown. If no piece can legally move according to the number thrown, play passes to the next player.

A player must throw a 6 to move a piece from the starting circle onto the first square on the track. The piece moves 6 squares around the circuit beginning with the appropriately colored start square (and the player then has another turn).

If a piece lands on a piece of a different color, the piece jumped upon is returned to its starting area. If a piece lands upon a piece of the same color, this forms a block. This block cannot be passed or landed on by any opposing piece.

## Winning
When a piece has circumnavigated the board, it proceeds up the home column. A piece can only be moved onto the home area by an exact throw.

The first person to move all 4 pieces into the home area wins.
